# Swift-iOS-Tip-Calculator

![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)


This app was built as part of the prework for CodePaths Tech Fellow Program

https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/ios_university/prework_tpm

This app is very generic and has a lot of room for improvement.

To use the calculator jus git clone the project and install it on your iOS device.

I may add features over time.
